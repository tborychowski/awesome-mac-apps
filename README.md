# My Awesome Mac Apps

## Foreword
Goal is the same as the [original repo](https://github.com/shahrviral/Mac-Setup), I just replaced the apps with the ones I use/prefer.
Quoting from the original repo (as it fits me perfectly):
> I am a mac app enthusiast who really enjoys trying new apps to see what best fits into my workflow. This originally started as, and still remains a reference for me when I setup a new computer, but I hope this helps others find what they need without having to  try everything. For the apps listed below, I was not compensated in any way. These are just the apps I use on a daily basis or use to use in the past. I try to prefer free solutions but occassionally I end up coming across a nice deal for a paid app which I can purchase at a price that is affordable. I try to avoid subscriptions unless I absolutely have to. I think the most expensive app I have purchased is Alfred.

Conversely from the original, I don't use any icons to demarkate free, paid or subscriptions.
I don't use subscription-based software (except at work, where it's provided by my employer).
The only exception is Bear app, because of it superior qualities and acceptable price ($15/year).<br>
All of the apps mentioned here are free and Open Source apps, unless explicitly stated.
I'm not against using paid apps, they are usually better, however I'm against paying too much for apps.
I'm also not against Electron apps, they often have a better UX and are more flexible than their native counterparts. Their alleged slownes or resource hunger is of no concern on a half-decent machine.
